    <h2>Relative Position</h2>
    <div id="box1">An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
         Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
          Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</div>

    <h2>Position Sticky</h2>
    <div id="box2">
        It is Sticky
        <p>A sticky element is positioned relative to its initial position in the HTML flow,
             until it crosses a threshold in the viewport (in other words, the user scrolls past a certain point on the page).
             At that point, the element “sticks” in place until it reaches the boundary of its parent element.</p>

    <div id="box3">
    <h2>Absolute</h2>
        <p>An element with position: absolute;
             is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
              However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors,
             it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</p>
